I have a strong desire to learn code and unable to finish my schooling atm so I'm teaching myself by exploring GitHub and other various sources to learn what I can on my own and with the help of friends and places like GitHub, Word Press, Weebly and W3Schools. My main hobby is PC gaming so most of the stuff I'm currently interested in working with revolves around gaming but I do have other websites I dabble in.
